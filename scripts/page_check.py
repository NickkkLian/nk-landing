"""page_check.py — the rules a booking page from this skill has to keep, checked on the file itself.

    python3 page_check.py <page.html> [<page.html> ...] [--public]
        --public: also refuse anything that would be wrong to put on the open web from a demo — a phone
        number outside the reserved 555-01xx range, a contact e-mail at a real-looking domain.
    python3 page_check.py --selftest

The rules, and the invariant each one serves (references/invariants.md):

  L01  the business data block is there and parses, and the page reads its content from it, not from the markup
  L02  demo mode is stated on the screen, and every row the outbox writes says it was not sent          (5)
  L03  no testimonials, star ratings, review counts or "trusted by" logos anywhere                      (—)
  L04  a page that says it is a demo uses a reserved 555-01xx number and an example.* e-mail            (—)
  L05  every write to the outbox happens inside the guard, the guard takes an approval, and each outbox
       row records the approval it came from                                                             (1)
  L06  the guard compares the actor, the request, the revision, the words actually going out and the kind
       of action, refuses reuse — and the page carries its own ?probe=1 battery that exercises them      (1–4)
  L07  the customer form has no control that approves; the approve buttons live in the staff view        (4)
  L08  every input has a label, the status regions announce, and focus is never removed silently        (—)
  L09  nothing is fetched from the network except the fonts the token file names                        (—)
  L10  colours come from the token file, not from raw hex in the page's own styles                      (—)
  L11  a page built for delivery is one file: no external stylesheet or script                          (—)
  L12  the footer says what is made up, and does not claim customers the page has not had               (—)
